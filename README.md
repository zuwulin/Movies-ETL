# Movies ETL

## Objective
The aim of the current project was to clean up a readily available online database of all movies created since the 1900s. The project included two major databased, divided into three categories: the wikipedia exctracts, the kaggle collection, as well as the Imdb's individual movie review collection. The data was cleaned to get rid of any TV shows, and to sort and unify the available information (such as the budget, ratings, descriptions, etc). 

The cleaned data was later on uploaded in an SQL DataBase for future use and maintenance.
